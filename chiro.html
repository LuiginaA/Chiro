    <p>
        I, Dr Janique Belli, believe everyone deserves the highest quality of a pain free healthy life.

        My goal is that my patients leave my office empowered with a better understanding of the 
        chiropractic treatment they received and a greater knowledge of the functioning of their body.
        Chiropractic is not merely a clinical procedure, it is a healing discipline of philosophy, science, 
        and art that is concerned with each patient as a whole.
